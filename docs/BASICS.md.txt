# Basics: How this privacy-preserving speaker search works

## TL;DR
Device turns audio → embedding → per-suspect scores → integer map (negative=match) → encrypts & permutes → server decrypts and returns index of the most negative. Client maps index → suspect name.

## Step 1: Embeddings
We use ECAPA (SpeechBrain) to turn a few seconds of speech into a vector. It captures **voice identity**, not words. We L2-normalize the vector.

## Step 2: Scoring
- **Cosine**: angle similarity in the unit sphere (−1..1; higher is more similar).
- **PLDA**: statistical score (log-likelihood ratio) in a transformed space.

## Step 3: Integer mapping
We convert each score to an integer where **negative ⇒ match**.

Cosine example:
